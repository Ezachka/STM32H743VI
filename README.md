It's just my hobbie CMSIS project for STM32  M7 core. ;
You can use libs:
    Low level:
- RCC is ok.
- i2c is great.
- tim is ok.
- usart is great.;
    High level:
- display_xxx is great, for 1602 , 1604 display and others with i2c.
- ad_9833 is great  (AD 9833 frequency generator).
- soft uart isn't mine, but works great.
- encoder is work ok, dont finish, it libs for few SSI ecoders (SESNA, KUBLER, ZETTLEX).
- SH1106 lib isn't mine, but has fixed by me .
